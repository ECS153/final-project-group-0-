# Choices For Development Stack
Items in bold are what we are currently using, though most definitely subject to change

## Hardware
* **Pi Zero W**
* Pi 4
* Arduino

## OS
 * *Raspbian Lite*
 * PiCore: Super small linux distro
 * PiPyOS: Bare Metal Python

## Runtime
  * Python
  * dotnet core (C#)
  * C/C++
 
## Etc
### Docker
 **+** Seperate containers for password database, request client, and local form server  
 **-** Will probably be more overhead than we can afford on pi zero
### Database
