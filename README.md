# SECRET- Secure Credential Transportation

## Collaborators
Martin Petrov, Marty Macalalad, Raza Ahmed

## Overall Goal
Our goal is to create a password manager that can keep a user's credentials untouchable by any malware that is on the computer the credentials are submitted from, as well as from man in the middle attacks on the local network. We feel that we can guarantee this by having the browser send randomly generated tokens in place of credentials, and then substituting the real credentials at the latest possible moment possible, via a proxy that would act as a man in the middle between the user and the router.
