# redirect to pi

## What it does ##

Currently the extension is able to generate username/pass/email and send to Glitch server and wait for response. It can ask the user if a type="text" field is sensitive.

In order to test, firefox is needed. Go to about:debugging -> this firefox -> load temporary addon. Once loaded, the pi icon 
can be use to scan a page for inputs and fill out as needed. Once done, a user can hit the ready button which sends to the glitch server. Currently glitch server only displays the body.
