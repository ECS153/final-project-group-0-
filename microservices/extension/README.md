# Redirect to pi

## What it does ##

Currently the extension is able to generate username/pass/email and send to server and wait for response. 

In order to test, firefox is needed. Go to about:debugging -> this firefox -> load temporary addon.  

From there, link to the manifest.json file along with the other files in the same directory and the extension should be loaded.

## How it All Works ##
### popup/* ### 
### manifest.json ###
### background.js ###
### script.js ###
