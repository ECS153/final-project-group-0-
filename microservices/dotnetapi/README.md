# SECRET API
## Introduction
This microservice is in charge of syncronizing and managing all of the other microservices. With the exception of handling user logins, it follows the RESTful api design pattern. We decided to use Dotnet Core because we felt that it had robust authentication modules that we could integrate fairly easily.

## Structure
It's a bit outside the scope of this README (as well as outside our scope) to properly explain the structure of Dotnet Core, though, so instead we'll just focus on the most critical parts of the code.

### User Registration




### User Login

### Creating a New Credential
