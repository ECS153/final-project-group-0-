# Milestones
For everyone in the group include one sentence on each of these (1) what you did last week (2) what you plan to do this week (3) anything that youâ€™re stuck on. 

## Milestone 1

### Martin
#### Work Done
This week I tested mitmproxy, a promising python proxy app, looked into setting up browser proxy rules to only use our pi as a proxy when required, researched npyscreen, a GUI framework that we are going to use, configured permissions for my vpn to allow Raza and Marty to have access to our raspberry pi, and started working on the GUI for the pi
#### Future Work
I'm also going to keep working on the GUI, and work with everyone to come up our *final* final design overall. 
#### Roadblocks
Based on what I've found out thus far, because proxies are on a lower TCP/IP level than the requests themselves, there might not be an elegant and reliable way to switch proxies based on http request types/urls. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to continue to spend energy on this problem or just accept it and let all traffic always route through the pi

### Raza
I worked on the extension to see how easy it to manipualte the page content and send to our Pi. This week I plan on working with my mates in an attemt to finalize our approach as we have had to make several changes in the previous days.
