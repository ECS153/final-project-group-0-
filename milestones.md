## Milestone 1

### Martin
As mentioned in the video, this week we didn't focus too much on actual coding, but rather researched potential frameworks/plugins that could help us acheive our idea. Nonetheless, this week I tested mitmproxy, a promising python proxy app, looked into setting up browser proxy rules to only use our pi as a proxy when required, researched npyscreen, a GUI framework that we are going to use, configured permissions for my vpn to allow Raza and Marty to have access to our raspberry pi, and started working on the GUI for the pi
