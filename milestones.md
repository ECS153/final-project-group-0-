## Milestone 1

### Martin
#### Work Done
This week I tested mitmproxy, a promising python proxy app, looked into setting up browser proxy rules to only use our pi as a proxy when required, researched npyscreen, a GUI framework that we are going to use, configured permissions for my vpn to allow Raza and Marty to have access to our raspberry pi, and started working on the GUI for the pi. I'm also going to keep working on the GUI, and work with everyone to come up our *final* final design overall. 

### Marty
I worked on documenting the meetings as well as discussing the similarities to other projects that are similar to ours.
This week I plan to continue working on the extension to handle the requests made to the Pi.

### Raza
I worked on the extension to see how easy it to manipulate the page content and send to our Pi. This week I plan on working with my mates in an attempt to finalize our approach as we have had to make several changes in the previous days.
